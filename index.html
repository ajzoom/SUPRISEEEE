            From the moment we met, my heart took flight,<br>
            With you by my side, everything feels right.<br>
            In laughter and love, we find our way,<br>
            I want to spend forever, come what may.<br><br>

            Together we’ll build our dreams anew,<br>
            Through every challenge, I’ll stand by you.<br>
            In every sunset and starry night,<br>
            My love for you will shine so bright.<br><br>

            So here’s to us, to our journey ahead,<br>
            With you, my love, I have nothing to dread.<br>
            Happy 10 months, and here’s my decree:<br>
            I want to spend the rest of my life with thee.<br><br>

            I will love you as the stars love the night,<br>
            As the sun embraces the dawn,<br>
            In every moment and every breath,<br>
            You are my eternal poem,<br>
            Written in the ink of my heart.<br><br>

            Through the seasons of life,<br>
            With each passing day,<br>
            My love for you grows deeper,<br>
            Like roots that hold firm in the earth,<br>
            Unyielding, forever entwined.<br><br>

            In the silence between words,<br>
            In the laughter we share,<br>
            I promise to cherish you always,<br>
            For you are the dream I awaken to,<br>
            The forever that fills my days.
